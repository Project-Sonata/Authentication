## [Sonata] Authentication

[Sonata] Authentication is a part of the Sonata Project.

The purpose of this microservice is to authenticate the users.

# Note: 
THE MICROSERVICE DOES NOT CREATE AND VALIDATE ANY TYPE OF TOKENS.

The main purpose of this service is login, authentication and user email confirmation.

If you want to create access token you should use Sonata-Authorization service that just delegates authentication to this microservice
